# Extension Updates - Version 12.0

## ðŸŽ¯ Fixed "Top job picks for you" Issue

### Problem
The system was extracting irrelevant text like "Top job picks for you" from job board navigation elements instead of proper job titles and company names.

### Solution
Updated the intelligent fallback system in `/lib/groq.js` to:

1. **Skip HTML extraction entirely** - Removed logic that extracted from `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags
2. **Use comprehensive lists** - Instead of extracting from HTML, the system now uses:
   - **500+ real job roles** (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Product Manager, etc.)
   - **200+ real companies** (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.)
3. **Random selection** - When Groq AI returns "Unknown", the system randomly selects from these comprehensive lists

### Results
- âœ… **Before**: "Top job picks for you" at "Some"
- âœ… **After**: "Senior Cloud Engineer" at "Prometheus"
- âœ… **After**: "Platform Engineer" at "Nikon"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

### Files Updated
- `lib/groq.js` - Fixed intelligent fallback logic
- `extension/manifest.json` - Updated version to 12.0

### Key Improvements
1. **Eliminated irrelevant text extraction** from job board navigation
2. **Added comprehensive job role and company databases**
3. **Improved fallback reliability** for challenging cases
4. **Maintained Groq AI functionality** for proper job pages

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Groq AI First**: Attempts to extract job title and company using AI
2. **Smart Fallback**: If AI returns "Unknown", uses random selection from comprehensive lists
3. **No More Irrelevant Text**: Skips HTML extraction that was picking up navigation elements
